The revisions I made to this project are I switched what keys you press so if you press the left or right arrow it allows for the new text to be updated to the right or left. I also fit the password to the middle so that it does not run off the page. The only way that the password can be changed is through the different keys that are given using if.. then.. statements, which act as conditionals. The variables I used was "previousWord" and "passwordExceptPreviousWord" which were used in place of the random words that would be generated in the function generateLookupKey().
